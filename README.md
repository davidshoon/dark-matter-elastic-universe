Dark matter and the elastic universe

A paper on how Dark matter could theoretically exist outside the universe (in string theory terms, the "D-Brane") and "pull" the universe outwards, at faster than speed of light (as expected from the initial big bang) and slowing down as it approaches a "bounding box" -- due to the inverse energy density of dark matter.

I also posit the idea of a warp drive, which requires shooting gravitons (which can "escape" the D-Brane) to generate a butterfly effect to create a vortex (as per Navier-Stokes, or whatever the equivalent is with dark matter/inverse energy density) such that it creates a warp bubble.
